    <p>The &quot;Build Plant Metabolic Model&quot; app generates a metabolic model for a plant. The user begins by supplying an annotated Genome object derived either from another KBase app (&quot;Plant Transcript Sequences to Annotated Genome&quot;) or from the collection of annotated public genomes pre-loaded in KBase. A metabolic model is generated from the PlantSEED-based metabolic annotation of the genome, and is then gap filled. The user can visualize the model.</p>

    step_2 : |
        additional instructions/details regarding the step with id step_2
