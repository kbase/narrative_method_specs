    <p>The Build and Normalize Metagenomic Functional Abundance Data app retrieves functional annotation abundance profiles for a selected set of metagenomes. Functional abundance profiles and matrices can be built for whole-genome shotgun (WGS) samples. E-value, percent identity, and alignment length values can be used to filter the annotation abundance data to the desired level of stringency. Use KBase’s Search feature to create a list of metagenomes and then specify options that define the various attributes (e.g., annotation e-value, percent identity, and level) to restrict the data that will be returned. Besides specifying the metagenome(s) to include and providing an output name, the most critical parameters for creating a profile are the functional level and source on which to base the annotation (Source Name). The second part of this app normalizes and standardizes the abundance profile data (log-transformation) to reduce experimental or technical bias among profiles, making them more comparable and reducing the chance of erroneous conclusions driven by non-biological trends in the data. Boxplots are generated for both raw and normalized data to display the distribution. The output of this app is an abundance profile for one or more metagenomes. The abundance profile contains the raw annotation abundance data returned for the selected set of data attributes. Abundance profiles serve as the inputs for all other community-related apps: normalization and visualizations (PCoA, heatmap-dendrograms, and rank abundance plots) to look for trends in the data and statistical analyses to identify the taxa or functions that drive these trends.</p>

step-descriptions :
    step_1 : |
        Specify the list of metagenomes and the attributes that will define the data that will be returned as an abundance profile. Returns a view of the abundance profile in table and boxplot format.
    step_2 : |
        Normalize abundance data for selected abundance profile. Returns a view of the abundance profile in table and boxplot format.
