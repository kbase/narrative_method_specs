    <p>The Compare Genomes from Pangenome app conducts a detailed comparison of genomes on the basis of protein sequence similarity and function. It begins by creating a pangenome for a set of closely related organisms. The pangenome is defined as the set of conserved and variable genes that are found within a set of related genomes. In many cases, this is a desirable analysis for understanding which genes were gained and lost between strains, or for inferring which genes may confer a phenotype to a given strain.</p>
