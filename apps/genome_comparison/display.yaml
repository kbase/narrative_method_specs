    <p>The &quot;Compare Genomes from Pangenome&quot; app conducts a detailed comparison of genomes on the basis of protein sequence similarity and function. To perform this task, the user may either upload a set of genomes into KBase or select from an existing set of genomes already in KBase. KBase will then compare the protein sequence similarity and function of these genomes. A detailed exportable report of the comparison results is generated by KBase.</p>
