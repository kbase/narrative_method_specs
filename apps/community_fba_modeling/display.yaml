    <p>The Reconstruct Community Metabolic Model app generates a community metabolic model to be used with model-associated apps in KBase (e.g., "Run Flux Balance Analysis") to predict fluxes. To begin, the user may either upload a set of metabolic models or select a set of public metabolic models already present in KBase. KBase will then assemble these models into a single compartmentalized community model. The user may also select or upload a growth condition to which the community model will be gap filled.</p>

step-descriptions :
    step_1 : |
        Select functional annotations organized by OTU from metagenome database
    step_2 : |
        Construct metabolic models for abudant OTUs and ensemble model for all remaining functions in annotated metagenome
    step_3 : |
        Merge all metagenome models into a single compartmentalized community model
    step_4 : |
        Gapfill community model to permit function on a specified growth condition
