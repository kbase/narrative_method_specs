    <p>The &quot;Reconstruct Community Metabolic Model&quot; app generates a community metabolic model to be used with model-associated apps in KBase (e.g., &quot;Run Flux Balance Analysis&quot;) to predict fluxes. To begin, the user may either upload a set of metabolic models or select a set of public metabolic models already present in KBase. KBase will then assemble these models into a single compartmentalized community model. The user may also select or upload a growth condition to which the community model will be gap filled.</p>
