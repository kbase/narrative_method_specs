parameters :
    input_expression_matrix :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select an Expression Matrix to visualize with a heatmap

    input_gene_ids :
        ui-name : |
            Features
        short-hint : |
            Select the features to compare
        long-hint  : |
            If no features are found, your expression dataset may not be associated with the Genome that contains the features. Use the Associate Expression Matrix to Genome Features method to associate your expression dataset with the proper Genome.

    input_featureset :
        ui-name : |
            Feature Set
        short-hint : |
            Include all the features from this FeatureSet

    min_colorvalue :
        ui-name : |
            Min. Color Range
        short-hint : |
            For the heatmap, set the value of the maximum color

    max_colorvalue :
        ui-name : |
            Max. Color Range
        short-hint : |
            For the heatmap, set the value of the minimum color

    <p>This method allows you to view and explore expression data as a sortable heatmap. The conditions&#47;samples are displayed on each row with some summary statistics averaged across the selected features. The conditions can be sorted by those values. Each of the selected features is represented in a simple heatmap in the table. Mouse over the heatmap to view specific expression values.</p>
    
    <p>The input is a .tsv file with "gene-id" listed in the A1 cell, the gene ids listed in the A column, the sample/conditions identifiers in the 1 row, and expression values that correspond to the gene-ids and sample throughout. For a comprehensive guide to formatting your expression data for import into KBase, see the <a href="http://kbase.us/data-upload-download-guide/expression-matrix/">Data Upload/Download Guide</a>.</p>
