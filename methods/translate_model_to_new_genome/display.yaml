            Translated Model ID
        short-hint : |
            Name of the translated model in the target organism

            Remove No-gene Reactions
        short-hint : |
            In the translated model certain reactions may be left without a gene assigned to them; entering "yes" in this field removes those reactions from the model.

description : |
    <p>Accurate metabolic models are based on well-curated genome annotations which are labor intensive and thus highly valuable. This method permits users to construct a metabolic model of a new organism based on a previously published model in another organism rather than constructing and curating it from scratch. The proteome comparison map between the source and the target organism generated by the <a data-method-id=Òcompare_two_proteomes_genericÓ>Compare Two Proteomes</a> method method is used to identify genes encoding potentially orthologous proteins in the two organisms. The method works best when the two organisms are closely related since that allows a large fraction of annotations to be accurately transferred to the target genome. Additionally, the transferred model may suggest missing annotations in the target genome thus improving the quality of its annotation.</p>
