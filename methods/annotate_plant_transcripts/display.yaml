parameters :
    input_genome :
        ui-name : |
            Source ID of Transcripts
        short-hint : |
            The ID of the set of transcripts to annotate (KBase object type: Genome).
        long-hint  : |
            The identifier of the set of transcripts (contained within a Genome object type) in the user's data set for which annotation is desired.


    output_genome :
        ui-name : |
            Output ID of Transcripts (optional)
        short-hint : |
            The ID of the set of newly annotated set of transcripts (KBase object type: Genome).
        long-hint  : |
            The set of newly annotated transcripts will overwrite the original set unless you specify a new ID (KBase object type: Genome).

    <p>This method uses the RAST approach to annotate plant transcripts with metabolic functions from the PlantSEED project. The PlantSEED project focused on high-quality annotation of plant primary metabolism, and some secondary metabolic pathways, in ten plant genomes. Signature k-mers were generated from this annotation for each metabolic function and then used to assign the same function to a transcript.</p>
    <p>The transcript data can be added to the system by clicking the + symbol in the Data panel, selecting the &quot;Import&quot; tab, then selecting &quot;Transcript&quot; from the dropdown menu. The user is presented with two boxes.  The first one lets you select the transcript FASTA file. Click on &quot;Select file&quot; to locate the transcript FASTA file on your computer and upload it to KBase. The progress of the upload is reflected in the box to the right of the "Select file" button. When the upload is finished (the progress box shows 100%), enter a name for the resulting data object in the second box and click the "Import" button.</p>

    <p><strong>Inputs</strong>
    
    <p><i>Genome</i><br>
    A set of plant mRNA transcripts.</p>
    
    <p><i>Media<br>
    Media specifies the set of chemical compounds organism can use for its growth</p>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Outputs</strong>
    
    <p><i>Genome</i><br>
    A set of metabolically annotated transcripts saved as data of "Genome" type.</p>
