            Dataset name
        description : |
            The name of the set of signature k-mers to use for annotating the plant transcripts. The SEED project frequently releases new and updated sets of signature k-mers for each round of annotation accomplished. The set that contains this parameter allows us to retrieve and use the signature k-mers computed via the PlantSEED project. We are currently using Release 70.

        ui-name : |
            k-mer size
        description : |
            The length of k-mer to use when annotating plant transcripts. When a set of signature k-mers is computed, the computation is done at various k-mer lengths. By default we are using the signature k-mers of 8 amino acids in length.
        
 
description : |
    <p>This method uses the RAST approach to annotate plant transcripts with metabolic functions from the PlantSEED project. The PlantSEED project focused on high-quality annotation of plant primary metabolism, and some secondary metabolic pathways, in ten plant genomes. Signature k-mers were generated from these genomes for each metabolic function and are then used to assign the same metabolic functions to a new set of plant transcripts or a plant genome.</p>
    
    <p>The system will treat a set of transcripts (both raw and annotated) as a "Genome" object.</p>
    
    <p>This method starts with either using import of transcript sequences (cDNA or protein sequences) in FASTA format or using transcript sequences stored as Genome object in KBase.</p>
    
    <p>The transcript data can be added to the system by clicking the + symbol in the Data Panel, selecting the &quot;Import&quot; tab, then selecting &quot;Transcript&quot; from the dropdown menu. The user is presented with two boxes.  The first one lets you select the transcript FASTA file. Click on &quot;Select file&quot; to locate the transcript FASTA file on your computer and upload it to KBase. The progress of the upload is reflected in the box to the right of the "Select file" button. When the upload is finished (the progress box shows 100%), enter a name for the resulting data object in the second box and click the "Import" button.</p>
    
    <p>A user can also add  one of more than fifty publicly available genomes from the Data Panel, by selecting the &quot;Public&quot; tab, then selecting &quot;Plant Genoms&quot; from the dropdown menu. Here a user is presented with a list of plant genomes, and a search box for them to find their preferred species. Each genome has an &quot;Add&quot; button to its left, which is used to add the genome to their narrative.</p>
