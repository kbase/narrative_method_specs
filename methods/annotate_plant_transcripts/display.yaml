parameters :
    input_genome :
        ui-name : |
            Source Genome ID
        short-hint : |
            The ID of the set of transcripts  to annotate.
        long-hint  : |
            The identifier of  the genome object in the user's data set which contains the set of plant transcripts for which annotation is desired


    output_genome :
        ui-name : |
            Output Genome ID (optional)
        short-hint : |
            The ID of the genome object to which the new annotated genome object should be saved
        long-hint  : |
            The annotated genome object will overwrite the original genome object unless you specify a new ID for the annotated genome object

    <p>This method uses the RAST approach to annotate plant transcripts with metabolic functions from the PlantSEED project. The PlantSEED project focused on high-quality annotation of plant primary metabolism, and some secondary metabolic pathways, in ten plant genomes. Signature k-mers were generated from this annotation for each metabolic function and then used to assign the same function to a transcript.</p>
    <p>The transcript data can be added to the system by clicking the + symbol in the Data panel, selecting the &quot;Import&quot; tab, then selecting &quot;Transcript&quot; from the dropdown menu. The user is presented with two boxes.  The first one lets you select the transcript FASTA file. Click on &quot;Select file&quot; to locate the transcript FASTA file on your computer and upload it to KBase. The progress of the upload is reflected in the box to the right of the "Select file" button. When the upload is finished (the progress box shows 100%), enter a name for the resulting data object in the second box and click the "Import" button.</p>

    <p><strong>Inputs</strong>

    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Outputs</strong>
    
    <p><i>Genome</i><br>
