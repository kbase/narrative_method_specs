description : |
    <p>Comparison of two different metabolic models identifies their core and unique reactions and compounds, along with the gene-protein associations between the two models. Proteome comparison data (see Compare Two Proteomes method) are used to identify the orthologous genes. This method produces an output table that lists core reactions, unique reactions, genes, and annotations associated with each biochemical reaction for the two compared metabolic models.</p>
