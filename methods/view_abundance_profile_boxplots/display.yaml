description : |
    <p>This method produces a boxplot image for one or more abundance profiles. Each bar, or column, represents the distribution of abundance data for a single metagenome. This visualization allows users to easily compare the distribution of values for all their samples. Samples that exhibit dissimilar distributions cannot be compared in a meaningful way. Normalization can account for differences in data distributions but not always. Users need to look at the distribution of post-normalization values to see if the distributions have been made more similar.</p>
    
    <p>If distributions still look extremely different, comparisons need to be regarded with a great deal of skepticism; it may not be possible to distinguish real biological differences from those driven by bias/error that may still be present in the data.</p>
