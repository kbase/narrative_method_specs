description : |
    <p>In this genome comparison algorithm, all of the proteins present in an input Pangenome object are compared based on their function and sequence. This comparison groups proteins into  protein families putatively sharing function and sequence-similar protein families. This comparison can be used to identify groups of homologous proteins that are not consistently annotated, or identify consistently annotated proteins that lack significant sequence similarity. In many cases, this method supports the identification and correction of annotation errors. In other cases, this method supports the identification of new and interesting biology (see publications listed below).  Generally, this comparison is valuable for assessing the extent of conservation among an input set of genomes. It also support studies of how genomes have evolved and adapted to their distinctive environments.</p>
    
    <p>This comparison builds on the sequence-based homologous protein families identified in the input Pangenome object, extending the data by also identifying protein families with putatively similar functions. Protein families with putatively similar functions are assembled by looking for sets of proteins with identical functional assignments. This protein family construction relies on the use of a consistent annotation ontology as well as annotation with the most specific terms available among all genomes included in the input set.</p>
