            Select the Expression Matrix for imputing missing values
        long-hint  : |
            Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab.

            If left blank, the input Expression Matix will be overwritten with the newly imputed values.


description : |
    <p>This method imputes the missing values of gene-ids for all of the samples or conditions contained within an Expression Matrix. The missing values are calculated by taking a mean of the gene expression values for all the samples in the specific rows with missing gene expression values</p>
