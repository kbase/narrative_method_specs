description : |
    FeatureSets are useful for grouping a set of Features and performing some operation on that
    set of Features.  For instance, instead of specifying all the Features in a list for each method,
    you can use this method to build a single FeatureSet, and pass this in as input for other
    methods.  FeatureSets are also sharable, so it allows you to call out or comment on specific
    Features in your Narrative.
