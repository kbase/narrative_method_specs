description : |
    <p>This method associates the rows of an Expression Matrix to features contained in the Genome by matching the row IDs to genome feature IDs or aliases. Methods that operate on expression data often require this mapping between rows and features to properly function. This method is can be used in case the Expression Matrix was not associated with a Genome upon importing or if an updated Genome becomes available to associate with the Expression Matrix.</p>
