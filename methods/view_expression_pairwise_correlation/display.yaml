parameters :
    input_expression_matrix :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the Expression Matrix to vizualize as a pairwise correlation
        long-hint  : |
            Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab.

    input_gene_ids :
        ui-name : |
            Features
        short-hint : |
            Select the features to compare
        long-hint  : |
            If no features are found, your expression dataset may not be associated with the Genome that contains the features. Use the Associate Expression Matrix to Genome Features method to associate your expression dataset with the proper Genome.

    input_featureset :
        ui-name : |
            Feature Set
        short-hint : |
            Include all the features from this FeatureSet.

    min_range :
        ui-name : |
            Min Color Range
        short-hint : |
            The color range of the heatmat will be calibrated to set this as the minimum value.

    max_range :
        ui-name : |
            Max Color Range
        short-hint : |
            The color range of the heatmat will be calibrated to set this as the maximum value.

    <p>This method allows you to view and explore pairwise correlation of selected features as a heatmap. Click on the Hide&#47;Show Selected Features button on the top of the heatmap to view and sort the summary statistics of expression values for selected features. Mouse over the heatmap to view specific correlation values.</p>
