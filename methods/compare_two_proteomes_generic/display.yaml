description : |
    <p>This method performs an all-vs-all proteome comparison for a pair of species. The algorithm determines sets of similar proteins based on the Best Unambiguous Sets (BUS) algorithm. As a pre-processing step, BUS eliminates all edges that are less than 80% of the maximum-weight edge, both in amino acid identity and in sequence length. Based on the resulting unambiguous matches, the algorithm builds blocks of conserved gene order (synteny) when neighboring genes in one species have one-to-one matches to neighboring genes in the other species; these blocks of conserved synteny are used to resolve additional ambiguities by preferentially keeping matches within synteny blocks. Finally, the algorithm searches for subsets of genes that are locally optimal, such that all best matches of genes within the group are contained within the group and no genes outside the group have matches within the group. The output of this method is visualized as a dot plot matrix showing pairs of similar proteins determined from the BUS algorithm.</p>
    
    <p>The output of this method is visualized as a dot plot matrix showing pairs of similar proteins determined from the BUS algorithm. This dot plot can be navigated by users with the provided zoom and scroll functions. Hovering over colored dots in the dot plot displays information about that pair of proteins. Clicking on a dot displays a column browser mode which allows one to navigate to the next or previous similar proteins in either genome. A larger red dot in the plot indicates the current pair of proteins.</p>
