parameters :
    input_data:
        ui-name : |
            Input Clusters
        short-hint : |
            Select the clusters to reconstruct with new tree height cutoff
        long-hint  : |
            Select the clusters to reconstruct with new tree height cutoff

    feature_height_cutoff:
        ui-name : |
            Tree height cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Metric for cutting the branches of the tree (percentage of tree height)
        long-hint  : |
            The tree height cutoff parameter affects the branching of clusters in the dendrogram. Subgroups that join at a distance below this value are put in the same cluster.

    out_clusterset_id :
        ui-name : |
            Output Clusters
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the reconstructed set of clusters
        long-hint  : |
            After the method has finished running, a ClusterSet data object will be added to your data panel. Provide a name for this data object, using only alphanumeric characters and underscores.


description : |
    <p>This method produces new clusters from an already prepared dendrogram (cluster tree) by applying a new cutoff value for cutting the branches of the dendrogram and then reconstructing the set of clusters. To run this method, select the existing set of clusters, define the height to cut the branches of the tree, and provide a name for the output set of clusters.</p>
    
    <p>This method is based on the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/cutree.html">cutree package for R</a>.</p>
