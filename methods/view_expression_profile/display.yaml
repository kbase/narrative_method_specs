    input_expression_matrix :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select an Expression Matrix to view


    input_gene_ids :
        ui-name : |
            Features
        short-hint : |
            Select the features to compare
        long-hint  : |
            If no features are found, your expression dataset may not be associated with the Genome that contains the features. Use the Associate Expression Matrix to Genome Features method to associate your expression dataset with the proper Genome.

    input_featureset :
        ui-name : |
            Feature Set
        short-hint : |
            Include all the features from this FeatureSet

    <p>This method allows you to plot and compare the average expression values of all features in Expression Matrix to the average expression values of selected features across the different conditions. Click on the Show/Hide Selected Features button on the top of the plot to view and sort based on the summary statistics of expression values for selected features. Mouse over the points on the plot to view condition specific average expression values.</p>
    
    <p>The input is a .tsv file with "gene-id" listed in the A1 cell, the gene ids listed in the A column, the sample/conditions identifiers in the 1 row, and expression values that correspond to the gene-ids and sample throughout.
