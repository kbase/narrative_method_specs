description : |
    <p>This method allows users to normalize their data. Data are normalized with a log-based transformation; transformed values are standardized within each sample. Normalized values are scaled from 0 to 1 across the entire dataset.</p>
    
    <p>It is good practice to view the boxplots (use the "Boxplots from Abundance Data" method) of raw and normalized data to determine if normalization is necessary prior to comparative analyses. Datasets that exhibit similar distributions across all samples are comparable (as raw or normalized values); those that exhibit a variety of distributions are not suitable for direct comparison and may require normalization and/or additional processing to remove bias that could adversely affect downstream comparisons.</p>
    
    <p>The normalized abundances  generated with this method can be used as input for all other microbial communities methods such as “Generate Heatmap from Abundance Data” “Generate PCoA Data from Abundance Data“, “Generate Rank Abundance Plot”  and “Boxplots from Abundance Data”.</p>
