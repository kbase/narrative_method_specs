    <p>View and explore expression data as a sortable heatmap. Features (genes) are displayed on each row with some summary statistics averaged across the selected conditions. The features can be sorted by those values. Each of the selected conditions is represented in a simple heatmap in the table. Mouse over the heatmap to view specific expression values.</p>

    <p>The input is a .tsv file with "gene-id" listed in the A1 cell, the gene ids listed in the A column, the sample/conditions identifiers in the 1 row, and expression values that correspond to the gene-ids and sample throughout.
