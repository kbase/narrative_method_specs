    <p>View the plot between the number of clusters k and the average silhouette width for the k clusters. The average silhoutte width provides an evaluation of the K-Means clustering validity and is used to estimate k for K-Means Clustering. Observations with a large silhouette width (near 1) are well clustered, observations near 0 lie between 2 clusters and observations with a negative silhouette width are placed in the wrong cluster.</p>
