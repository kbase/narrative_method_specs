description : |
    <p>Draft metabolic models usually have missing reactions (gaps) due to incomplete or incorrect functional genome annotations. As a result, these models are unable to generate biomass on media where the organism typically is capable of growing. Gapfilling algorithms can be used to overcome this problem. These algorithms tentatively fill metabolic gaps by identifying the minimal number of biochemical reactions to add to the draft metabolic model to enable it to produce biomass in a specified media. Gapfilling is an optimization procedure that can produce multiple solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Once a set of gapfilling solutions is successfully generated by this method, users can view these solutions. Viewing each gapfilling solution is recommended to determine the one that is most biologically plausible and best fits the physiological aspects of the given organism.</p>
    
    <p>Biochemistry data used in the model construction pipeline have been gathered from multiple published metabolic models and from public databases such as KEGG, MetaCyc, EcoCyc, Plant BioCyc, Plant Metabolic Networks, and Gramene. Currently, the biochemistry database in KBase includes more than 13,000 biochemical reactions and over 16,000 metabolic compounds.</p>
