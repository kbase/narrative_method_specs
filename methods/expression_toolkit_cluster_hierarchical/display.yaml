parameters :
    input_expression_matrix:
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the Expression Matrix to use for hierarchical clustering
        long-hint  : |
            Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab.

    feature_height_cutoff:
        ui-name : |
            Tree height cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Metric for cutting the branches of the tree
        long-hint  : |
            The tree height cutoff parameter affects the branching of clusters in the dendrogram. Subgroups that join at a distance below this value are put in the same cluster. 

    output_cluster_set :
        ui-name : |
            Set of clusters
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for set of clusters generated by algorithm
        long-hint  : |
            After the method has finished running, an ClusterSet data object will be added to your data panel. Provide a name for this data object, using only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

    distance_metric :
        ui-name : Distance metric
        short-hint : Measure of distance used between pairs of observations 
        long-hint  : This must be one of "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary", "pearson", "abspearson", "correlation", "abscorrelation", "spearman" or "kendall".

    linkage_criteria :
        ui-name : Linkage criteria
        short-hint : Determines the dissimilarity of sets based of the distances between observations in the sets 
        long-hint  : This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of) one of "ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid","centroid2".
        
    algorithm :
        ui-name : Algorithm
        short-hint : Select between a normal clustering algorithm (hclust) and a fast version (flashClust)
        long-hint  : Select between a normal clustering algorithm (hclust) and a fast version (flashClust)


description : |
    <p>This method organizes gene expression data into a dendrogram (cluster tree) by using distance and linkage criteria to analyze dissimilarity between observations in the data and sorting these observations into the branches of the tree. Agglomerative clustering is used to build a hierarchy of clusters by progressively merging individual clusters into groups. This is useful for understanding the similarities and dissimilarities between sets of data based on their grouping patterns throughout the cluster tree.</p>

    <p>Begin by selecting or importing both the expression dataset to analyze and the genome associated with the expression dataset using the Add Data button. Provide a name for the output set of clusters. Define the height to cut the branches of the tree, set the parameters for computing the dissimilarity between sets, and select the hierarchical clustering algorithm to use for the analysis.</p>
